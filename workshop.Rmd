Workshop Goals!

* Gain familiarity with RStudio
* Learn basic R commands
* Load data into RStudio
* Create Data Visualizations using ggplot

This document is an "R Notebook", which is a good choice for running R code.  R Notebooks are a mix of text/markdown, and R code "chunks". Below is an example of a code chunk. You can click the 'play' button to run the code chunk.

```{r}
#assigns 10 to the variable x
x<-10

#prints value of x
x

```

```{r}
library("tidyverse")

```


```{r}


avgPupCount7Tr1<-read.delim("test1.txt")
avgPupCount7Tr1


```
